#Hello WORLD!

Hello fellow coders!

I am Arav, but in the digital world, I am FireBlower871. I like to play sports, like soccer, table tennis, cricket, and basketball. I also like to play video games. I am a currently learning to code in python. It is very fun. You can make fun games, and you can make cool graphics too! Ever since I started coding, I have loved it. Anyway, that is a bit about myself. See you in the digital world!
